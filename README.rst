Dirhunt is a web crawler optimize for **search and analyze directories**. This tool can find interesting things if the
server has the *"index of"* mode enabled. Dirhunt is also useful if the directory listing is not enabled. It detects
directories with **false 404 errors**, directories where an **empty index file** has been created to hide things and
much more.

.. code-block:: console

    $ dirhunt http://website.com/

Dirhunt does not use brute force. But neither is it just a **crawler**. This tool is faster than others because it
minimizes requests to the server. Generally, this tool takes **between 5-30 seconds**, depending on the website and
the server.
